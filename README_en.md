# 👋 Hello, I'm Felipe Rodrigues Fonseca!
"I am a backend developer specializing in Python, with experience in developing scalable REST APIs and system integration.
I am always looking for new challenges and growth opportunities.
Currently, I am diving deeper into new technologies like Docker and pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of the People.

## 🚀 Goals and Opportunities
- 🎯 Deepening my knowledge in backend development with Python, focused on REST APIs, PostgreSQL, Django, Django Rest Framework, and integration with Docker.
- 🤝 Always open to collaborating with the community, especially on open-source projects.
- 📫 If you want to talk about technology, exchange ideas, or collaborate on a project, I'm available!

## 📂 Featured Projects
Here are some projects that reflect my learning and application of the technologies I am studying:

### 📝 Python / Selenium Automation (Private Project)
A project I created to automate the scheduling and booking of classrooms on the web platform
at my workplace. The automation drastically reduced the time required for classroom scheduling,
freeing up resources for more strategic tasks. Its structure consists of persisting registration data
in an adapted Google Sheet, and then, via API, using this data in conjunction with Selenium
to open the portal, log in the user, fill out the reservation sheet, and complete the scheduling.

### 💡 Geo Nexus - Web Platform with Python / Django, PostgreSQL, Django Rest Framework (Private Project)
GeoNexus is a web platform composed of two other platforms. One of them, GeoPampa, was built using Python, Django, and Folium.
Its objective is to help new students locate buildings, facilities, and bus stops with the help of an interactive map.
It is also possible to trace routes, calculate the distance between two locations, among other features. The other, GeoNature,
is a web platform integrated with an API I built using Django Rest Framework. It has the functionality to display information related
to the wild animals found on campus and also to be used as a
study tool and an incentive for environmental preservation. Thus, the project promotes the union between technology, the environment, and data,
presenting a robust and scalable solution for a real-world scenario in my work environment. This project was hosted on AWS using an EC2 server,
with a fixed IP and a domain purchased on the platform, and with an SSL/TLS security certificate.
### 🔄 API built with Django Rest Framework and PostgreSQL (Personal Project)
An API created for the persistence and management of data and information related to wild animals
that were found and cataloged at my workplace. With this, it is possible to handle all the information
efficiently and securely through the functionalities provided by Django Rest Framework and PostgreSQL, resulting in an
effective integration with my other project, GeoNature!
